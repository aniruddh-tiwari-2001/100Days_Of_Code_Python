    "Words that contain many consecutive consonants, like \"schtschurowskia\", are generally considered somewhat hard to pronounce.\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that a word is hard to pronounce if it contains 4 or more consonants in a row; otherwise, it is easy to pronounce. For example, \"apple\" and \"polish\" are easy to pronounce, but \"schtschurowskia\" is hard to pronounce.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string **S** consisting of **N** lowercase Latin characters. Determine whether it is easy to pronounce or not based on the rule above — print \"YES\" if it is easy to pronounce and \"NO\" otherwise.\n",
